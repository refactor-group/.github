# Welcome! 👋

Have you ever thought to yourself that you know you can become a better software developer (professionally or for fun) if you could get
someone with experience to provide you some help and guidance? Well that's exactly what this open source software community is for. We're
an international group of software craftspeople who love building free software and helping others learn how to do this better.

We're a community of engineers from all around the world and we call ourselves _Rust Never Sleeps_. Indeed, Rust never needs to sleep,
but _you_ still need to. Put code to work intelligently so you can rest more and realize your full human potential! :)

We're hosted and sponsored by [Refactor Group](https://refactorgroup.com), a company specializing in coaching
and mentoring software engineers and engineering leaders to better reach their full career potential.

Currently we are focused on:

1. Build useful and substantial projects that solve real world problems
2. Are a place to learn and grow your comprehensive software development skillset with others who have all levels of experience (just getting started
to multiple decades of software building experience) from around the world. Learn how to build and maintain professional software over a complete lifecycle.
3. Provide opportunities for you to gain experience through practicing software development alongside a diverse set of beginning and experienced Rust developers.

We hang out on a Slack community called [Rust Never Sleeps](https://rustneversleepshq.slack.com/).

We welcome new members into the community! Please feel free to browse around the repositories, clone the existing source code, try to get everything running,
and even contribute bug fixes or to contributing a new feature.

### Join the Rust Never Sleeps Community
(Both our Slack & GitHub Projects)

If you'd like to join a diverse group of software developers from around the world building

<!-- GETTING INVOLVED -->

## Getting Involved

You can get involved in a number of ways:

### Join our Community Slack Discussion and Biweekly Meetups

We create intentional community, currently in two main areas that you are welcome to join:

1. [Rust Never Sleeps Slack discussion](https://rustneversleepshq.slack.com/)
   * We care deeply about creating diverse, supportive community. If you'd like to join our Slack community and GitHub organization, [please take a moment to fill out this brief set of questions to help us get to know you a bit better](https://rustneversleeps.wufoo.com/forms/z1x3dy1j0ycafxq/)

2. A biweekly call:
   * ~~North/South America - Every other Thursday at 19:00 (UTC-6)~~ <-- currently on hiatus


You may find our meetings notes and current community focus for each current software project here:

<!-- SOFTWARE PROJECTS -->

# Software Projects

## Overview

### Active Projects

**Software Engineering Coaching & Mentorship Platform:**

Seeking to build a platform designed specifically for software engineering coaches and tech industry leaders to guide and mentor engineers to grow in specific ways.

1. [Next.js + TailwindCSS frontend](https://github.com/refactor-group/refactor-platform-fe)
2. [Rust backend](https://github.com/refactor-group/refactor-platform-rs)


### Inactive Projects

The __Edge Project__ refers to the embedded/IoT aspects of the system including the hardware sensors, embedded board (Raspberry Pi Pico)
and embedded Rust source code.

👀 [Browse the Edge Project board](https://github.com/orgs/refactor-group/projects/3/views/1) that has all current feature/bug work

A subproject of Edge, the __ESP32-WROOM-RP project__ is our effort to write an embedded Rust crate for all RP2040 series boards that lack WiFi but can gain WiFi ability via ESP32-WROOM-* boards

👀 [Browse the ESP32-WROOM-RP Project board](https://github.com/orgs/refactor-group/projects/5) that has all current project feature/bug work

The __Ambi Project__ refers to the web backend and frontend components of this system acting as a local or cloud-hosted system that
processes, morphs and gives meaning to the data collected by the Edge pieces of the system.

👀 [Browse the Ambi Project board](https://github.com/orgs/refactor-group/projects/1/views/1?layout=board) that
has all current feature/bug work


## Edge / Ambi Projects explore two main goals:

1. Creating a simple, highly performant IoT framework to collect and control hardware/software agents at the edge that:
    * Are almost always connected to the internet
    * Are intermittently connected to the internet
2. The use of the exciting new highly performant, safe and scalable Rust lang both for embedded and cloud implementations as well
  as use of Elixir for cloud implementations

<!-- SOFTWARE ENGINEER COACHING AND MENTORSHIP -->

# Software Engineer Coaching and Mentorship

The community exists as part of [professional software engineer coaching](https://www.refactorcoach.com) and is available to help you master all technical, communication, organizational and relational aspects of being a master software engineer. It's also how the bills get paid which allows for this community to exist which includes covering living expenses for Jim Hodapp.

Even though the community exists under the coaching business umbrella, you do not need to participate in coaching if that's not what you're currently needing. Learning from and participating in this community exists as a compliment to Jim's coaching services, but you will certainly benefit from just starting with community participation. Feel free to jump in, ask questions and propose changes to any
of the software that the community is working on. You'll get quality feedback on your pull requests which is already something very valuable in helping you become a better software engineer.

If you would like to learn more about professional software and leadership coaching, please
[read more about it here](https://www.refactorcoach.com/coaching) and [schedule a completely free
session with Jim](https://calendly.com/refactor-coach/30min).
