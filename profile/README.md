We're a professional software agency and engineering community building custom software and open source projects while helping engineers grow their careers through one-on-one and group-based coaching.

## What We Do

### Custom Software Development

Refactor Group is an AI-embracing software agency delivering custom solutions across the full technology stack. We specialize in:

- **Full Stack Web Applications** — Modern, scalable web platforms built with TypeScript, React, Next.js, Ruby, Elixir, Python, and Go
- **Embedded & Bare Metal Systems** — Low-level firmware and IoT solutions using Rust, C, and C++
- **Open Source Development** — Deep experience contributing to and maintaining open source projects, both individually and as a team

Our engineers bring decades of combined experience across diverse domains including IoT, multimedia, SaaS, and embedded systems. We work with modern languages like **Rust**, **TypeScript**, **Go**, **Python**, **Ruby**, and **Elixir**, alongside deep expertise in **C**, **C++**, **Java**, and **.NET**.

### Software Engineer Coaching

Through [Refactor Coaching](https://refactorcoach.com), we offer expert coaching programs designed specifically for software engineers at every career stage. Our coaching covers:

- **Career Direction & Job Transitions** — Define your path, prepare for interviews, negotiate offers
- **Technical Skill Development** — Full stack development, Rust, embedded systems, software architecture
- **Engineering Leadership** — Management skills, communication, and organizational influence
- **AI-Era Effectiveness** — Harness AI tools to boost your productivity and evolve your skillset

Work one-on-one with experienced coaches who understand your challenges and are dedicated to helping you reach your full potential. [Schedule a free introductory session](https://refactorcoach.com/coaching) to learn more.

#### Scripter to Rust Cohort

New to Rust and coming from Python or another dynamically-typed language? Join our **Scripter to Rust** cohort — a 6-week group-based program following a custom-developed curriculum where you'll learn Rust by building a complete JSON parser from scratch.

This coach and mentor-led, project-based program covers ownership, borrowing, enums, error handling, FFI, and Python bindings. You'll ship a real project, build your portfolio, and join a community of developers making the same transition. Come learn how Rust can help you become a much better software engineer, enrich your software career, and make some new friends while you're doing it.

## Refactor Coaching Platform

We're building an open source platform designed for coaches and engineering leaders to guide and mentor software engineers toward specific growth outcomes.

**Status:** Currently in beta testing with early users

The platform provides tools for professional independent coaches, informal mentors, and engineering leaders to facilitate and enhance their coaching practice. Built with a **Rust backend** and **Next.js frontend**, it's an active open source project with opportunities for engineers to contribute.
